An OGTC1 Team looking at home heating system data and how it might be controlled

Data used from a live system. 

Data reveals that the system needs to be harmonised prior to making dynamic.
Balance is achieved when hot water is avaiable unrestricted whe required and 
radiators are comfortable when required.

Key info to be extracted from Data:
Usage patterns - Heating systems during summer and winter
Usage patterns - Heating patterns weekdays vs weekends
Usage patterns - Heating peaks identified by increase of 20 degrees in 10 minutes
Usage patterns - Heating peaks terminated when general downward trend for 30 mins
Usage patterns - Hot water peaks identified by increase of 20 degrees in 10 minutes
Usage patterns - Hot water peaks terminated when general downward trend for 30 mins
System boosts/manual overides for heating should be recorded - any regularly 
occuring intervals should be ammended to be added to the usage patterns.

Rules for System
If temperature coming back into boiler is excess of 50C then divert flow into radiator
If temperature coming back into boiler is below 50C then flow into boiler.
Water temperature going from boiler to water tank must be atleast 65C to ensure killing bacteria
